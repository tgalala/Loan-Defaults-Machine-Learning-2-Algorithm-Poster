# Comparison of Naïve Bayes and Ensemble Boosted Trees Applied for Loan Defaults Dataset


<b>Language</b><br>
MATLAB

<b>Introduction</b><br>


Primary objective is to compare and contrast the performance of two Machine learning models—Naïve Bayes and Ensemble
Boosted Trees. We have selected a binary classification problem where we aim to predict whether an individual will default on their loan obl igations given a set of features.
