# Comparison of Naïve Bayes and Ensemble Boosted Trees Applied for Loan Defaults Dataset

Primary objective is to compare and contrast the performance of two Machine learning models—Naïve Bayes and Ensemble
Boosted Trees.

We have selected a binary classification problem where we aim to predict whether an individual will default on their loan obl igations given a set of features.

Note: Matlab code is available on request
