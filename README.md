Comparison of Naïve Bayes and Ensemble Boosted Trees Applied for Loan Defaults Dataset.

Introduction and Motivation

Primary objective is to compare and contrast the performance of two Machine learning models—Naïve Bayes and Ensemble
Boosted Trees.

We have selected a binary classification problem where we aim to predict whether an individual will default on their loan obl igations
given a set of features.
