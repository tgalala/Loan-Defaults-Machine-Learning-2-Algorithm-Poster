# Comparison of Naïve Bayes and Ensemble Boosted Trees Applied for Loan Defaults Dataset


<b>Language</b><br>
MATLAB

<b>Description</b><br>
Primary objective is to compare and contrast the performance of two Machine learning models—Naïve Bayes and Ensemble
Boosted Trees. We have selected a binary classification problem where we aim to predict whether an individual will default on their loan obl igations given a set of features.

<b>Script Files Description</b><br>
1. Part1_stats_processing.m : Runs descriptive statistics, preprocessing and Under Sampling (Also includes Over Sampling code which was not used)
2. Part2_BoostedTreesModelTuning.m : Runs the basic ensemble model & hyperparamter tuning for optimal boosted trees model using cross validation (10 Folds).
3. Part3_NaiveBayesModelTuning.m : Runs basic Naive Bayes model & hyperparamter tuning for the optimal naive bayes model using cross validation (10 Folds)
4. Final_test.m : Runs final test comparision between Boosted Ensemble trees and Naive Bayes final optimized models with with the performance metrics and performance charts for the two algorithms.
